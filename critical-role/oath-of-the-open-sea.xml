    <description>
      <p>The Oath of the Open Sea calls to sea-faring warriors, swashbuckling sailors, and journeying guardians who seek the thrill of an endless horizon. Driven to seek the adventure and mystery across and beneath every endless oceanic expanse, paladins who swear this oath stand against those who would deny the liberties afforded to likeminded travelers, rooting out the tyrannical and corrupt that claim any shore. Such guardians believe in the natural beauty of the sea, often making offerings and prayers to entities or deities like the Wild Mother or Storm Lord that influence safe passage, while often feeling called to hunt those monstrosities that seek to terrorize and spoil the waters with wanton violence and ill intent.</p>
      <h5 class="caption">TENETS OF THE OPEN SEA</h5>
      <p>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>No Greater Life than a Life Lived Free.</em>
        </strong>One should be free to chart their own path without oppression. Those who would exert their power to dominate others shall be smote.</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Trust the Skies.</em>
        </strong>The guidance of a strong breeze. The rumbling warnings of a coming storm. Nature is a source of portent and council that should be heeded.</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Adapt like the Water.</em>
        </strong>The waters of the ocean can shift around any obstacle or become an impassable one. They can carve around and reveal the secrets of the past or swallow the truth and hide it forever. To embrace this fluidity is to be ready for any challenge.</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <strong>
          <em>Explore the Uncharted.</em>
        </strong>The world is filled with much mystery. Through the pursuit of these enigmatic ends, one can both uncover those who hide their dark deeds in shadow to be judged, and find the path to becoming something great.</p>

      <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <b>
          <i>Marine Layer.</i>
        </b>As an action, you can channel the sea to create a thick cloud of fog that surrounds you and heavily obscures the area for 20 feet in all directions, following you as you move. You and all creatures within 5 feet of you instead treat this fog as lightly obscured. This fog lasts for 10 minutes, spreads around corners and cannot be dispersed.
			</p>
      <p class="indent">
        <b>
          <i>Fury of the Tides.</i>
        </b>As a bonus action, you can channel the powerful might of the waves to bolster your attacks for 1 minute. Once per turn for the duration, when you hit a creature with weapon attack, you can choose to push the target 10 feet away from you. If the target is pushed into an obstacle or another creature, they take additional bludgeoning damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
